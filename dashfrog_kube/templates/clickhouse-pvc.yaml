DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used.
ClickHouse now uses a StatefulSet with volumeClaimTemplates (see clickhouse-deployment.yaml).
StatefulSets automatically manage PVCs, ensuring stable storage across pod recreations.

This file is kept for reference but will not create any resources.
To fully remove it, delete this file from the templates directory.
